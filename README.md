## Honesty

```text
Honestly the default CSS and all that was made by some arabic guy on sourceforge.
Sourceforge is a fucking gold mine of old arabic dudes that code what you can't I tell ya.
Regardless, all that was coded for me was the /public/themes/default.css and the edits for that needed in /public/index.html
```

This was coded in [Replit](https://replit.com) btw

## Don't Be A Skid.

## This Is Open Source Though

This is open source so you all *can* use my code.  Your a skid tho

That being said all this code was made myself through painful hours of work, so still give credits where due!

## To everyone saying my proxy is ass...
